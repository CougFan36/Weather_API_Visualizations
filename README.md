# Weather_API_Visualizations
A repository to examine latitude and longitude impacts on weather.  In this analysis, we take a random sample of longitudes and latitudes, find the closest cities to those longitude and latitude coordinates, and then pull data from the Open Weather API to create a data frame of theses cities.

We then generate plots and linear regressions based on this data to determine if being closer or further away from the equator has any kind of impact on weather factors, including max temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, and humidity.  Our assumption is that distance to the equator will certainly have an impact on temperature.
